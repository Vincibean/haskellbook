-- Comprehend Thy Lists

-- let mySqr = [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]

-- [x | x <- mySqr, rem x 2 == 0]
--   takes all the even numbers contained in mySqr
--   [4, 16]

-- [(x, y) | x <- mySqr, y <- mySqr, x < 50, y > 50]
--   takes all the numbers contained in mySqr and creates a tuple whose first element will always be less than 50
--   and whose second element will always be greater than 50.
--   However, there's no number in mySqr which is greater than 50, so no value will be generated, resulting in an empty list.
--   []

-- take 5 [ (x, y) | x <- mySqr, y <- mySqr, x < 50, y > 50 ]
--   same as above, but now we only take the first 5 elements. Since take [] simply returns [], this function will simply return

-- Bottom Madness
-- Will it blow up?

-- 1. Will the following expression return a value or be ⊥?
--    [x^y | x <- [1..5], y <- [2, undefined]]
--    ⊥

-- 2. take 1 $ [x^y | x <- [1..5], y <- [2, undefined]]
--    No; it will return the first element: 1^2 -> 1

-- 3. sum [1, undefined, 3]
--    ⊥

-- 4. length [1, 2, undefined]
--    Only the spine is needed, not the actual values, so this will work and return 3

-- 5. length $ [1, 2, 3] ++ undefined
--    length will throw an error on a bottom value if part of the spine itself is bottom; so this will return
--    ⊥

-- 6. take 1 $ filter even [1, 2, 3, undefined]
--    Haskell is lazy and values are calculated on demand; here, we get a result before having to evaluate undefined,
--    so we will get a result: [2]

-- 7. take 1 $ filter even [1, 3, undefined]
--    Haskell is lazy and values are calculated on demand; here, we don't get a result before having to evaluate undefined; so this will return
--    ⊥

-- 8. take 1 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]
--    Haskell is lazy and values are calculated on demand; here, we get a result before having to evaluate undefined,
--    so we will get a result: [1]

-- 9. take 2 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]
--    Haskell is lazy and values are calculated on demand; here, we get a result before having to evaluate undefined,

-- 10. take 3 $ filter odd [1, 3, undefined]
--     Haskell is lazy and values are calculated on demand; here, we don't get a result before having to evaluate undefined, so we will get a result:

-- 4. What does the following mystery function do? What is its type?
--    itIsMystery xs = map (\x -> elem x "aeiou") xs
--    It returns a list of Booleans, where each Boolean indicates if a particular character of the input value is a (lowercase) vowel
--    isIsMystery :: [Char] -> [Boolean]

-- 5. What will be the result of the following functions:
-- a) map (^2) [1..10]
--    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

-- b) map minimum [[1..10], [10..20], [20..30]]
--    [1, 10, 20]

-- c) map sum [[1..5], [1..5], [1..5]]
--    [15, 15, 15]

-- 6.
-- map (\x -> if x == 3 then (-x) else (x)) [1..10]
-- map (\x -> bool x (-x) (x == 3)) [1..10]

-- Filtering
-- 1. Given the above, how might we write a filter function that would give us all the multiples of 3 out of a list from 1-30?
multiplesOf3 = filter (\x -> x `rem` 3 == 0) [1..30]

-- 2. How could we compose the above function with the length function to tell us *how many* multiples of 3 there are between 1 and 30?
-- length $ filter (\x -> x `rem` 3 == 0) [1..30]

-- Zipping exercises

zip' [] _          = []
zip' _ []          = []
zip' (a:as) (b:bs) = (a, b) : zip' as bs

-- 2. Do what you did for zip, but now for zipWith :: (a -> b -> c)-> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
zipWith' :: (a -> b -> c)-> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
zipWith' _ [] _          = []
zipWith' _ _ []          = []
zipWith' f (a:as) (b:bs) = f a b : zipWith' f as bs

-- 3. Rewrite your zip in terms of the zipWith you wrote.
zip'' :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
zip'' = zipWith' (,)

-- Data.Char

-- isUpper :: Char -> Bool
-- toUpper :: Char -> Char

-- 3. Write a function that will capitalize the first letter of a String and return the entire String.
capitalize :: String -> String
capitalize ""     = ""

-- 4. Now make a new version of that function that is recursive such that if you give it the input “woot” it will holler back at you “WOOT.”

holler' :: String -> String
holler' ""     = ""
