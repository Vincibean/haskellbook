-- Exercises: Type Matching
-- Functions:
-- a)not
--   not :: Bool -> Bool
-- b)length
--   length :: [a] -> Int
-- c)concat
--   concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
-- d)head
--   head :: [a] -> a
-- e)(<)
--   (<) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool

-- Exercises: Type Arguments
-- Given a function and its type, tell us what type results from applying some or all of the arguments.

-- 1. If the type of f is a -> a -> a -> a, and the type of x is Char then the type off x is
--    a) Char -> Char -> Cha

-- 2. If the type of g is a -> b -> c -> b, then the type of g 0 'c' "woot" is
--    d) Char

-- 3. If the type of h is (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b, then the type of h 1.0 2 is
--    d) Num b => b

-- 4. If the type of h is (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b, then the type of h 1 (5.5 :: Double) is
--    c) Double

-- 5. f the type of jackal is (Ord a, Eq b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of jackal "keyboard" "has the word jackal in it"
--    a) [Char]

-- 6. If the type of jackal is (Ord a, Eq b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of jackal "keyboard"
--    e) Eq b => b -> [Char]

-- 7. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of kessel 1 2 is
--    d) (Num a, Ord a) => a

-- 8. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of kessel 1 (2 :: Integer) is
--    a) (Num a, Ord a) => a

-- 9. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of kessel 1 (2 :: Integer) is
--    c) Integer

-- Exercises: Parametricity
-- 2. The hypothetical function a -> a -> a has two – and only two – implementations.
-- Write both possible versions of a -> a -> a.
iid :: a -> a -> a
iid a1 _ = a1

iid' :: a -> a -> a
iid' _ a2 = a2

-- 3. Implement a -> b -> b.  How many implementations can it have?
iid'' :: a -> b -> b
iid'' _ b = b

-- Does the behavior change when the types of a and b change?
--   No.

-- Exercises: Apply Yourself
-- 1. The signature will be: myConcat :: [Char] ++ [Char]
--    The compiler knows the function (++) and has one value to work with already that it knows is a [Char].

-- 2. Two instances of Num are given, but the operation that we apply are (*) (which is contrained to Num) and (/) (which is
--    constrained to Fractional). Hence, the input type must have an instance of Fractional.

-- 3. myTake's first argument is passed to take, whose first argument is an Int, so myTake's first argument must be Int.

-- 4. length returns a Int, and it is applied as the second argument of (<). This "fixes" the first argument to be of the same type.

-- 5. Similarly as before, here the second argument of (<) is a Char. This "fixes" the first argument to be of the same type.

-- Multiple choice
-- 1. A value of type [a] is
--    c) a list whose elements are all of some type a

-- 2. A function of type [[a]] -> [a] could
--    a) take a list of strings as an argument

-- 3. A function of type [a] -> Int -> a
--    b) returns one element of type a from a list

-- 4. A function of type (a, b) -> a
--    c) takes a tuple argument and returns the first value

-- Determine the type

-- 1.a. Num a => a
-- 1.b. Num a => (a, String)
-- 1.c. (Integer, String)
-- 1.d. Bool
-- 1.e. Int
-- 1.f. Bool

-- 2. Num a => a

-- 3. Num a => a -> a

-- 4. Fractional a => a -> a

-- 5. String

x = print
y = print "woohoo!"

-- 3.
-- Won't compile; it can be fixed with:
a = (+)
b = a
c = b 10
d = c 200

-- 4
-- Won't compile
-- a = 12 + b
-- b = 10000 * c

-- Type variable or specific type constructor?
